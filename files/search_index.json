Greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere by human activities is a major contributor to global warming. Carbon dioxide (CO2) accounts for 76% of the greenhouse gases that we emit. The goal of this project is to study the carbon dioxide emissions of different countries over the years. We aim to understand what are the countries that contribute the most towards global warming through their CO2 emissions. We also try to answer what activities in these countries contribute to this emissions and suggest some solutions that can reduce this problem.

As the countries in Asia (China and India) with large populations started to industrialize in the 1990s their CO2 emissions steadily increased. China and India overtook Russia by early and mid 2000s respectively and China became the largest emitter of CO2 overtaking the United States in 2005.

In 1970s the main activity resulting in CO2 emissions for industrialized countries such as US, Japan was generating electricity and heat where as for countries such as India and China it was from manufacturing and industry. By 1990s the main CO2 generating activity for all the countries in the top 5 was generating electricity and heat. Note: The data from Russia is missing in the years 1975 and 1985. 5.3 How electricity is produced Since a large percent of CO2 emission comes from the production of electricity and heat, the following cleveland dot plot shows the percentage of different methods of electricity production. theme_dotplot &lt;- theme_bw(14) + theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = rel(.75)), axis.ticks.y = element_blank(), axis.title.x = element_text(size = rel(.75)), panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(), panel.grid.major.y = element_line(size = 0.5), panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank()) data_names &lt;- list(c(&quot;EG.ELC.PETR.ZS&quot;,&quot;Oil&quot;),c(&quot;EG.ELC.NUCL.ZS&quot;,&quot;Nuclear&quot;),c(&quot;EG.ELC.NGAS.ZS&quot;,&quot;Natural Gas&quot;),c(&quot;EG.ELC.HYRO.ZS&quot;,&quot;Hydro&quot;),c(&quot;EG.ELC.COAL.ZS&quot;,&quot;Coal&quot;)) t = get_all_data(top_n,data_names) for (y in years){ st= subset(t, year==y) p&lt;-ggplot(st, aes(value, fct_reorder2(country_name, DataType, value, .desc = FALSE), color = DataType)) + geom_point() + ggtitle(&quot;Electricity Produced from Different Sources Distribution&quot;,y) +xlab(&quot;%&quot;)+ ylab(&quot;Country&quot;)+theme_dotplot print(p) } Countries that has high CO2 emission in recent years like China and India rely mainly on coal to produce electricity which has a huge carbon footprint. The US used to have high percentage of electricity production using coal. However, in the more recent years, natural gas and nuclear power increased in electricity production. Moving towards environmentally friendlier methods of electricity production such as Nuclear, Hydro and Solar can help drastically reduce CO2 emissions. Investment into these methods is low right now as they might not be economically vaiable. As such governments of these countries should take responsibility to make these methods more profitable. This can be done by directly by implementing policies that promote these methods or by funding reseach and development that help make these methods profitable.

"],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion The goal of our project is to answer the following three questions: What countries are responsible for the greatest amount of co2 emissions? What could be the possible causes for this CO2 emissions? What are the possible ways we can reduce this? Our first plot shows the movement of CO2 emissions (kilotons) of the top 20 countries with the highest GDP from 1960 to 2015. The result shows that in 1960, the US, Russia, China, the UK and France had the highest CO2 emissions. In the past 50 years, many countries had a steady increase in CO2 emissions due to rapid industrialization in countries like China and India, the countries with the highest CO2 emissions changed drastically. Starting 2005, China exceeded the US to become the largest CO2 emitter in the world. The most recent largest contributors of CO2 emissions are China, the US, India, Russia and Japan. From the previous observations, we wanted to take a closer look at what is causing the CO2 emissions of the five largest CO2 contributors. There are five main sources of carbon dioxide emissions: Buildings Electricity and heat Manufacturing and construction Transportation And other miscellaneous causes In 1975, India and China’s main source of CO2 emissions was from manufacturing and construction. After the 1990s, the biggest contributor to CO2 emissions is Electricity and heating for most countries. Since electricity is one of the biggest sources of CO2 is electricity production, we listed out some methods of electricity production and its percentage in the electricity market. China and India rely the most heavily on coal. Combined with the significant increase in CO2 production and increasing use of electricity in these two countries, we can conclude that a high percentage of CO2 emission comes from the production of electricity using coal. Some countries like the US had a decrease in the CO2 emission in recent years. From the Cleveland dot plots of a few years 1975, 1985, 1995, 2005, 2014, we can see that the US is using less and less coal in order to produce electricity. There is a higher percentage of electricity production using natural gas and nuclear power, which can be a reason for the decrease in CO2 production in recent years. "]]

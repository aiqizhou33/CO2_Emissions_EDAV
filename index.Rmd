# Introduction

We are currently experiencing a drastic increase in the global average temperatures which is causing unpredictable weather conditions and the ocean levels around the world to rise. Greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere by human activities is a major contributor to global warming. Carbon dioxide (CO2) accounts for 76% of the greenhouse gases that we emit. 

The goal of this project is to study the carbon dioxide emissions of different countries over the years. We aim to understand what are the countries that contribute the most towards global warming through their CO2 emissions. We also try to answer what activities in these countries contribute to this emissions and suggest some solutions that can reduce this problem.
